# Two Fer

`Two-fer` or `2-fer` is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

```
"One for X, one for me."
```

When X is a name or "you".

If the given name is "Alice", the result should be "One for Alice, one for me."
If no name is given, the result should be "One for you, one for me."

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for JavaScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

    jasmine <exercise-name>.spec.js

Replace `<exercise-name>` with the name of the current exercise. E.g., to
test the Two Fer exercise:

    jasmine two-fer.spec.js

All tests but the first have been skipped. Once you get a test passing,
you can unskip the next one by changing `xit` to `it`.
