Rick and Morty S4E6 Never Ricking Morty

Rick: You did the most important thing.  You... Your bought something.

Morty: What?

R: You bought something. With money. God. I love money so much, Morty.

M: Are you being sarcastic?

R: Merchandise, Morty. Your only purpose in life is to buy and consume merchandise. And you did it. You went into a store - an actual honest-to-God store and you bought something. You didn't ask questions or raise ethical complaints. You just looked straight in the bleeding jaws of capitalism and said "Yes, Daddy, please." And I'm... I'm so prooud of you I only wish you could have bought more. I... I love buying things so much, Morty.

M: Rick, are...?  Are you...? Do you need to go to the hospital?

R: I love you, Morty. Give Grandpa a kiss. Give... give... gimme... Give grandpa a kiss.  Lips if you want. Whatever you're comfortable with. Some cultures to that.

M: (Kisses him on forehead)

R: That was sweet. Thank you. I-I love you. You're my little buddy. OK. Let's watch some interdimensional cable.
...

R: Hey what the BLEEP Morty? The train you got me just completely derailed itself. There's blood all over the windows on it.

M: Oh, man, I'm sorry Rick. I guess I'll return it.

R: Return?! Are you insane? Did you hear nothing I said? Buy another one, Morty! Consume, Morty. Nobody's out there shopping with this BLEEP virus. Where's your BLEEP wallet?!

...

M: Are they alive?
R: Of course. But not in any ways that matter.
Announcer: They. Have. No. Souls. Puppets. Of. Fate.
R: The Story Train, available now in the Citadel of Ricks. Buy it ironically.  Buy it sincerely. Just Buy it. Not buying it is an act of buying it. Buy it now. Buy it. Buy the train. We want you to buy the train.
