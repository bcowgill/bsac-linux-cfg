When polygon clicked info window comes up sized propertly and shows id and coordinate

Added /api/sample/random/ handler to generate a random circular data sample for testing

Dashboard Commit
setup-dashboard.sh remove check for Blis::Auth::Oauth2::Client as it seems no longer being built
switched bips_modules to libblis-modules-perl as that seems the right thing to do. David can confirm I hope.
lib-check-system.sh updated to latest. pushd_dir/pop_dir/file_is_executable

Project 42 commit
making date/time in URL easier
routes/api.js cleanDateTime() and cleanTimeRanges() added to convert 2014-07-12.13.45.12 to 2014-07-12 13:45:12 for passing to the database

map-polygon.js - checking first/last polygon point, if same pop last one off, google closes polygons automatically

# Changes #

* libblis-modules-perl used instead of bips_modules as that seems right. David can perhaps confirm.
* removed check for Blis::Auth::Oauth2::Client as it seems that is no longer built
* update lib-check-system.sh to latest (push_dir/pop_dir/file_is_executable)

# Test #

You need to run the setup because things have changed.
Turn on the FORCE_PERL setting in your setup/my-setttings.sh then run the setup:
```
#!bash
cd setup
./setup-dashboard.sh

/fail/sync and /fail/async handlers moved to /api/fail/sync...
database.js added bind parameters to .count, .fetchOne and .fetchAll methods

Just an adjustment to sql-query-bind error message.

tried writing a test for lowercase bind markers but realise cannot make a reliable
warning as could pass in an object with more variables than markers as normal operation
so can't compare number of bind markers vs number of keys in the object. As a result
incorrectly marked queries will just generate database query parse errors.

NAME
       git-bisect - Find by binary search the change that introduced a bug

SYNOPSIS
       git bisect <subcommand> <options>

DESCRIPTION
       The command takes various subcommands, and different options depending on the subcommand:

           git bisect help
           git bisect start [--no-checkout] [<bad> [<good>...]] [--] [<paths>...]
           git bisect bad [<rev>]
           git bisect good [<rev>...]
           git bisect skip [(<rev>|<range>)...]
           git bisect reset [<commit>]
           git bisect visualize
           git bisect replay <logfile>
           git bisect log
           git bisect run <cmd>...

       This command uses git rev-list --bisect to help drive the binary search process to find which change introduced a bug, given an old "good" commit
       object name and a later "bad" commit object name.

       git bisect start HEAD template-prettified^

Post-click tracking integration with UI - ENG-1315
This will integrate post-click tracking systems into the Dashboard. Currently, these are very manual to set-up and report on. This will cover: web-based tracking through the Blis tracker; third-party web-based tracking through systems like DoubleClick; in-app tracking through Hasoffers, Apptimizer etc.; any extra tracking required to support video. (Brent)

Allow the UI to fully set-up campaigns with new bidder features
All features supported by the bidder should have concomitant sections in the Dashboard, at least for Ad Ops to use. Nothing should rely on Parvez or other engineers editing the database directly. This is an ongoing job as the bidder is developed, obviously, but the Q2 work specifically covers the features already in the bidder with no current Dashboard UI. Ideally, this should be completed in the next couple of sprints, before Parvez goes on holiday. (Brent, Parvez)

UI Redesign
Alongside developing the current Dashboard, we will look at a complete redesign, with reference to other industry-standard Dashboards. In Q2, the focus will be on collecting ideas and scoping out a high-level design, rather than implementation. (Chris, Brent, Amy, Frances)

Project 42
This is a tool to gain insight into how customers move around, and will be an aid to both Blis and Talon when planning campaigns. The proposed visualisation is a map overlaid with a dynamic heatmap drawn from our lat/long data and tracking the same user/device IDs over time. (Brent)
