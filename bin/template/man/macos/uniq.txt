     uunniiqq -- report or filter out repeated lines in a file

     The uunniiqq utility reads the specified _i_n_p_u_t___f_i_l_e comparing adjacent lines, and writes a copy of
     each unique input line to the _o_u_t_p_u_t___f_i_l_e.  If _i_n_p_u_t___f_i_l_e is a single dash (`--') or absent, the
     standard input is read.  If _o_u_t_p_u_t___f_i_l_e is absent, standard output is used for output.  The
     second and succeeding copies of identical adjacent input lines are not written.  Repeated lines
     in the input will not be detected if they are not adjacent, so it may be necessary to sort the
     files first.

     The following options are available:

     --cc      Precede each output line with the count of the number of times the line occurred in the
             input, followed by a single space.

     --dd      Only output lines that are repeated in the input.

     --ff _n_u_m  Ignore the first _n_u_m fields in each input line when doing comparisons.  A field is a
             string of non-blank characters separated from adjacent fields by blanks.  Field numbers
             are one based, i.e., the first field is field one.

     --ss _c_h_a_r_s
             Ignore the first _c_h_a_r_s characters in each input line when doing comparisons.  If speci-
             fied in conjunction with the --ff option, the first _c_h_a_r_s characters after the first _n_u_m
             fields will be ignored.  Character numbers are one based, i.e., the first character is
             character one.

     --uu      Only output lines that are not repeated in the input.

     --ii      Case insensitive comparison of lines.

     The LANG, LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE environment variables affect the execution of uunniiqq as
     described in environ(7).

     The uunniiqq utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     The historic ++_n_u_m_b_e_r and --_n_u_m_b_e_r options have been deprecated but are still supported in this
     implementation.
