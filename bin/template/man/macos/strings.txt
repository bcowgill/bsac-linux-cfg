       _S_t_r_i_n_g_s  looks  for  ASCII strings in a binary file or standard input.  _S_t_r_i_n_g_s is useful for
       identifying random object files and many other things.  A string is any sequence  of  4  (the
       default)  or  more  printing characters [ending at, but not including, any other character or
       EOF].  Unless the -- flag is given, _s_t_r_i_n_g_s looks in all sections of the object  files  except
       the (__TEXT,__text) section.  If no files are specified standard input is read.

       The  file  arguments may be of the form _l_i_b_x_._a_(_f_o_o_._o_), to request information about only that
       object file  and  not  the  entire  library.    (Typically  this  argument  must  be  quoted,
       _`_`_l_i_b_x_._a_(_f_o_o_._o_)_'_'_, to get it past the shell.)

       The options to _s_t_r_i_n_g_s(1) are:

       --aa     This  option  causes  _s_t_r_i_n_g_s  to  look for strings in all sections of the object file
              (including the (__TEXT,__text) section.

       --      This option causes _s_t_r_i_n_g_s to look for strings in all bytes of the files (the  default
              for non-object files).

       ----     This option causes _s_t_r_i_n_g_s to treat all the following arguments as files.

       --oo     Preceded each string by its offset in the file (in decimal).

       --tt _f_o_r_m_a_t
              Write  each string preceded by its byte offset from the start of the file.  The format
              shall be dependent on the single character used as the format option-argument:

       _d      The offset shall be written in decimal.

       _o      The offset shall be written in octal.

       _x      The offset shall be written in hexadecimal.

       --_n_u_m_b_e_r
              The decimal _n_u_m_b_e_r is used as the minimum string length rather than the default of  4.

       --nn _n_u_m_b_e_r
              Specify  the  minimum  string  length, where the number argument is a positive decimal
              integer. The default shall be 4.

       --aarrcchh _a_r_c_h___t_y_p_e
              Specifies the architecture, _a_r_c_h___t_y_p_e_, of the file for _s_t_r_i_n_g_s(1) to operate  on  when
              the  file  is a universal file.  (See _a_r_c_h(3) for the currently know _a_r_c_h___t_y_p_es.)  The
              _a_r_c_h___t_y_p_e can be "all" to operate on all architectures in the file.
