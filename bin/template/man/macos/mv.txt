     mmvv -- move files

     In its first form, the mmvv utility renames the file named by the _s_o_u_r_c_e operand to the destina-
     tion path named by the _t_a_r_g_e_t operand.  This form is assumed when the last operand does not
     name an already existing directory.

     In its second form, mmvv moves each file named by a _s_o_u_r_c_e operand to a destination file in the
     existing directory named by the _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y operand.  The destination path for each operand is
     the pathname produced by the concatenation of the last operand, a slash, and the final pathname
     component of the named file.

     The following options are available:

     --ff      Do not prompt for confirmation before overwriting the destination path.  (The --ff option
             overrides any previous --ii or --nn options.)

     --ii      Cause mmvv to write a prompt to standard error before moving a file that would overwrite
             an existing file.  If the response from the standard input begins with the character
             `y' or `Y', the move is attempted.  (The --ii option overrides any previous --ff or --nn
             options.)

     --nn      Do not overwrite an existing file.  (The --nn option overrides any previous --ff or --ii
             options.)

     --vv      Cause mmvv to be verbose, showing files after they are moved.

     It is an error for either the _s_o_u_r_c_e operand or the destination path to specify a directory
     unless both do.

     If the destination path does not have a mode which permits writing, mmvv prompts the user for
     confirmation as specified for the --ii option.

     As the rename(2) call does not work across file systems, mmvv uses cp(1) and rm(1) to accomplish
     the move.  The effect is equivalent to:

           rm -f destination_path && \
           cp -pRP source_file destination && \
           rm -rf source_file

     The mmvv utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     The command "mv dir/afile dir" will abort with an error message.

LLEEGGAACCYY DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
     In legacy mode, the command "mv dir/afile dir" will fail silently, returning an exit code of 0.

     For more information about legacy mode, see compat(5).

     The --nn and --vv options are non-standard and their use in scripts is not recommended.

     The mmvv utility now supports HFS+ Finder and Extended Attributes and resource forks.  The mmvv
     utility will no longer strip resource forks off of HFS files.  For an alternative method, refer
     to cp(1).

SSTTAANNDDAARRDDSS
     The mmvv utility is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'') compatible.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     A mmvv command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.
