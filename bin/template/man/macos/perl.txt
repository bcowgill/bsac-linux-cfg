       The _p_e_r_l_d_o_c program gives you access to all the documentation that comes with Perl.  You can
       get more documentation, tutorials and community support online at <http://www.perl.org/>.

       If you're new to Perl, you should start by running "perldoc perlintro", which is a general
       intro for beginners and provides some background to help you navigate the rest of Perl's
       extensive documentation.  Run "perldoc perldoc" to learn more things you can do with _p_e_r_l_d_o_c.

       For ease of access, the Perl manual has been split up into several sections.

       On a Unix-like system, these documentation files will usually also be available as manpages
       for use with the _m_a_n program.

       Some documentation is not available as man pages, so if a cross-reference is not found by
       man, try it with perldoc.  Perldoc can also take you directly to documentation for functions
       (with the --ff switch). See "perldoc --help" (or "perldoc perldoc" or "man perldoc") for other
       helpful options perldoc has to offer.

       In general, if something strange has gone wrong with your program and you're not sure where
       you should look for help, try making your code comply with uussee ssttrriicctt and uussee wwaarrnniinnggss.
       These will often point out exactly where the trouble is.

       Perl officially stands for Practical Extraction and Report Language, except when it doesn't.

       Perl was originally a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting
       information from those text files, and printing reports based on that information.  It
       quickly became a good language for many system management tasks. Over the years, Perl has
       grown into a general-purpose programming language. It's widely used for everything from quick
       "one-liners" to full-scale application development.

       The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient, complete) rather than
       beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).  It combines (in the author's opinion, anyway) some of
       the best features of sseedd, aawwkk, and sshh, making it familiar and easy to use for Unix users to
       whip up quick solutions to annoying problems.  Its general-purpose programming facilities
       support procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming paradigms, making Perl a
       comfortable language for the long haul on major projects, whatever your bent.

       Perl's roots in text processing haven't been forgotten over the years.  It still boasts some
       of the most powerful regular expressions to be found anywhere, and its support for Unicode
       text is world-class.  It handles all kinds of structured text, too, through an extensive
       collection of extensions.  Those libraries, collected in the CPAN, provide ready-made
       solutions to an astounding array of problems.  When they haven't set the standard themselves,
       they steal from the best -- just like Perl itself.

       Using the "use strict" pragma ensures that all variables are properly declared and prevents
       other misuses of legacy Perl features.

       The "use warnings" pragma produces some lovely diagnostics. One can also use the --ww flag, but
       its use is normally discouraged, because it gets applied to all executed Perl code, including
       that not under your control.

       See perldiag for explanations of all Perl's diagnostics.  The "use diagnostics" pragma
       automatically turns Perl's normally terse warnings and errors into these longer forms.

       Compilation errors will tell you the line number of the error, with an indication of the next
       token or token type that was to be examined.  (In a script passed to Perl via --ee switches,
       each --ee is counted as one line.)

       Setuid scripts have additional constraints that can produce error messages such as "Insecure
       dependency".  See perlsec.

       Did we mention that you should definitely consider using the uussee wwaarrnniinnggss pragma?

BBUUGGSS
       The behavior implied by the uussee wwaarrnniinnggss pragma is not mandatory.

       Perl is at the mercy of your machine's definitions of various operations such as type
       casting, aattooff(()), and floating-point output with sspprriinnttff(()).

       If your stdio requires a seek or eof between reads and writes on a particular stream, so does
       Perl.  (This doesn't apply to ssyyssrreeaadd(()) and ssyysswwrriittee(()).)

       While none of the built-in data types have any arbitrary size limits (apart from memory
       size), there are still a few arbitrary limits:  a given variable name may not be longer than
       251 characters.  Line numbers displayed by diagnostics are internally stored as short
       integers, so they are limited to a maximum of 65535 (higher numbers usually being affected by
       wraparound).

       You may submit your bug reports (be sure to include full configuration information as output
       by the myconfig program in the perl source tree, or by "perl -V") to
       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.

       Perl actually stands for Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister, but don't tell anyone I said
       that.

NNOOTTEESS
       The Perl motto is "There's more than one way to do it."  Divining how many more is left as an
       exercise to the reader.

       The three principal virtues of a programmer are Laziness, Impatience, and Hubris.  See the
       Camel Book for why.
