     The llnn utility creates a new directory entry (linked file) which has the same modes as the
     original file.  It is useful for maintaining multiple copies of a file in many places at once
     without using up storage for the ``copies''; instead, a link ``points'' to the original copy.
     There are two types of links; hard links and symbolic links.  How a link ``points'' to a file
     is one of the differences between a hard and symbolic link.

     The options are as follows:

     --FF    If the proposed link (link_name) already exists and is a directory, then remove it so
           that the link may occur.  The --FF option should be used with either --ff or --ii options.  If
           none is specified, --ff is implied.  The --FF option is a no-op unless --ss option is speci-
           fied.

     --hh    If the _l_i_n_k___n_a_m_e or _l_i_n_k___d_i_r_n_a_m_e is a symbolic link, do not follow it.  This is most use-
           ful with the --ff option, to replace a symlink which may point to a directory.

     --ff    If the proposed link (link_name) already exists, then unlink it so that the link may
           occur.  (The --ff option overrides any previous --ii options.)

     --ii    Cause llnn to write a prompt to standard error if the proposed link exists.  If the
           response from the standard input begins with the character `y' or `Y', then unlink the
           proposed link so that the link may occur.  Otherwise, do not attempt the link.  (The --ii
           option overrides any previous --ff options.)

     --nn    Same as --hh, for compatibility with other llnn implementations.

     --ss    Create a symbolic link.

     --vv    Cause llnn to be verbose, showing files as they are processed.

     By default, llnn makes _h_a_r_d links.  A hard link to a file is indistinguishable from the original
     directory entry; any changes to a file are effectively independent of the name used to refer-
     ence the file.  Hard links may not normally refer to directories and may not span file systems.

     A symbolic link contains the name of the file to which it is linked.  The referenced file is
     used when an open(2) operation is performed on the link.  A stat(2) on a symbolic link will
     return the linked-to file; an lstat(2) must be done to obtain information about the link.  The
     readlink(2) call may be used to read the contents of a symbolic link.  Symbolic links may span
     file systems and may refer to directories.

     Given one or two arguments, llnn creates a link to an existing file _s_o_u_r_c_e___f_i_l_e.  If _l_i_n_k___n_a_m_e is
     given, the link has that name; _l_i_n_k___n_a_m_e may also be a directory in which to place the link;
     otherwise it is placed in the current directory.  If only the directory is specified, the link
     will be made to the last component of _s_o_u_r_c_e___f_i_l_e.

     Given more than two arguments, llnn makes links in _l_i_n_k___d_i_r_n_a_m_e to all the named source files.
     The links made will have the same name as the files being linked to.

     When the utility is called as lliinnkk, exactly two arguments must be supplied, neither of which
     may specify a directory.  No options may be supplied in this simple mode of operation, which
     performs a link(2) operation using the two passed arguments.

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY
     The --hh, --ii, --nn and --vv options are non-standard and their use in scripts is not recommended.
     They are provided solely for compatibility with other llnn implementations.

     The --FF option is FreeBSD extention and should not be used in portable scripts.

SSTTAANNDDAARRDDSS
     The llnn utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 (``POSIX.2'').

     The simplified lliinnkk command conforms to Version 2 of the Single UNIX Specification (``SUSv2'').

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     An llnn command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.
