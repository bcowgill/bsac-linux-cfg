     The ttaaiill utility displays the contents of _f_i_l_e or, by default, its standard input, to the stan-
     dard output.

     The display begins at a byte, line or 512-byte block location in the input.  Numbers having a
     leading plus (`+') sign are relative to the beginning of the input, for example, ``-c +2''
     starts the display at the second byte of the input.  Numbers having a leading minus (`-') sign
     or no explicit sign are relative to the end of the input, for example, ``-n 2'' displays the
     last two lines of the input.  The default starting location is ``-n 10'', or the last 10 lines
     of the input.

     The options are as follows:

     --bb _n_u_m_b_e_r
             The location is _n_u_m_b_e_r 512-byte blocks.

     --cc _n_u_m_b_e_r
             The location is _n_u_m_b_e_r bytes.

     --ff      The --ff option causes ttaaiill to not stop when end of file is reached, but rather to wait
             for additional data to be appended to the input.  The --ff option is ignored if the stan-
             dard input is a pipe, but not if it is a FIFO.

     --FF      The --FF option implies the --ff option, but ttaaiill will also check to see if the file being
             followed has been renamed or rotated.  The file is closed and reopened when ttaaiill
             detects that the filename being read from has a new inode number.  The --FF option is
             ignored if reading from standard input rather than a file.

     --nn _n_u_m_b_e_r
             The location is _n_u_m_b_e_r lines.

     --qq      Suppresses printing of headers when multiple files are being examined.

     --rr      The --rr option causes the input to be displayed in reverse order, by line.  Addition-
             ally, this option changes the meaning of the --bb, --cc and --nn options.  When the --rr option
             is specified, these options specify the number of bytes, lines or 512-byte blocks to
             display, instead of the bytes, lines or blocks from the beginning or end of the input
             from which to begin the display.  The default for the --rr option is to display all of
             the input.

     If more than a single file is specified, each file is preceded by a header consisting of the
     string ``==> _X_X_X <=='' where _X_X_X is the name of the file unless --qq flag is specified.

SSTTAANNDDAARRDDSS
     The ttaaiill utility is expected to be a superset of the IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 (``POSIX.2'') speci-
     fication.  In particular, the --FF, --bb and --rr options are extensions to that standard.

     The historic command line syntax of ttaaiill is supported by this implementation.  The only differ-
     ence between this implementation and historic versions of ttaaiill, once the command line syntax
     translation has been done, is that the --bb, --cc and --nn options modify the --rr option, i.e., ``-r
     -c 4'' displays the last 4 characters of the last line of the input, while the historic tail
     (using the historic syntax ``-4cr'') would ignore the --cc option and display the last 4 lines of
     the input.
