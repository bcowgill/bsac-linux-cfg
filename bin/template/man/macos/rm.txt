     The rrmm utility attempts to remove the non-directory type files specified on the command line.
     If the permissions of the file do not permit writing, and the standard input device is a termi-
     nal, the user is prompted (on the standard error output) for confirmation.

     The options are as follows:

     --dd          Attempt to remove directories as well as other types of files.

     --ff          Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation, regardless of the
                 file's permissions.  If the file does not exist, do not display a diagnostic mes-
                 sage or modify the exit status to reflect an error.  The --ff option overrides any
                 previous --ii options.

     --ii          Request confirmation before attempting to remove each file, regardless of the
                 file's permissions, or whether or not the standard input device is a terminal.  The
                 --ii option overrides any previous --ff options.

     --PP          Overwrite regular files before deleting them.  Files are overwritten three times,
                 first with the byte pattern 0xff, then 0x00, and then 0xff again, before they are
                 deleted.

     --RR          Attempt to remove the file hierarchy rooted in each file argument.  The --RR option
                 implies the --dd option.  If the --ii option is specified, the user is prompted for
                 confirmation before each directory's contents are processed (as well as before the
                 attempt is made to remove the directory).  If the user does not respond affirma-
                 tively, the file hierarchy rooted in that directory is skipped.

     --rr          Equivalent to --RR.

     --vv          Be verbose when deleting files, showing them as they are removed.

     --WW          Attempt to undelete the named files.  Currently, this option can only be used to
                 recover files covered by whiteouts.

     The rrmm utility removes symbolic links, not the files referenced by the links.

     It is an error to attempt to remove the files ``.'' or ``..''.

     When the utility is called as uunnlliinnkk, only one argument, which must not be a directory, may be
     supplied.  No options may be supplied in this simple mode of operation, which performs an
     unlink(2) operation on the passed argument.

     The rrmm utility exits 0 if all of the named files or file hierarchies were removed, or if the --ff
     option was specified and all of the existing files or file hierarchies were removed.  If an
     error occurs, rrmm exits with a value >0.

NNOOTTEE
     The rrmm command uses getopt(3) to parse its arguments, which allows it to accept the `--' option
     which will cause it to stop processing flag options at that point.  This will allow the removal
     of file names that begin with a dash (`-').  For example:
           rm -- -filename
     The same behavior can be obtained by using an absolute or relative path reference.  For exam-
     ple:
           rm /home/user/-filename
           rm ./-filename

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     rmdir(1), undelete(2), unlink(2), fts(3), getopt(3), symlink(7)

BBUUGGSS
     The --PP option assumes that the underlying file system is a fixed-block file system.  In addi-
     tion, only regular files are overwritten, other types of files are not.

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY
     The rrmm utility differs from historical implementations in that the --ff option only masks
     attempts to remove non-existent files instead of masking a large variety of errors.  The --vv
     option is non-standard and its use in scripts is not recommended.

     Also, historical BSD implementations prompted on the standard output, not the standard error
     output.

SSTTAANNDDAARRDDSS
     The rrmm command is almost IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'') compatible, except that POSIX requires
     rrmm to act like rmdir(1) when the _f_i_l_e specified is a directory.  This implementation requires
     the --dd option if such behavior is desired.  This follows the historical behavior of rrmm with
     respect to directories.

     The simplified uunnlliinnkk command conforms to Version 2 of the Single UNIX Specification
     (``SUSv2'').

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     A rrmm command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.
