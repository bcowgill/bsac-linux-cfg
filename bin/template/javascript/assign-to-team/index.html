			<p>You need to provide a list of tasks in one box below and a description of
				your cross-functional team roles and people in another box below. The tasks will
				be divided up between smaller teams, generated at random.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The format is quite simple. A hash mark '#' comments out a line so it will
					be ignored. For example if a given person is currently away.
				</li>
				<li>A line that ends with a colon ':' defines a role type or begins a list of
					tasks to divide up.</li>
				<li>Task lines are specified as task: tasks: story: or stories:</li>
				<li>A line with end: stop: quit: or go: indicates that there is no more. The
					tasks will be divided up at this point.</li>
				<li>Other lines will be added to the current context, either a role list or a
					task list.</li>
