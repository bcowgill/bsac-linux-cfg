This contains sample templates for a React Redux + Storybook new component generator script in use at one point in time.

It also has my set-ref-dom-name utility and an app title setting utility.

Was thinking of changing the replacement code to support different types of case replacements:
If the user originally gives an object in Camel Case then alternate case versions are accessed via a suffix:

%OBJ%       ObjectName
%OBJ_CAMEL% objectName
%OBJ_SNAKE% object_name
%OBJ_KEBAB% object-name
%OBJ_CONST% OBJECT_NAME
%OBJ_DOTS%  object.name
