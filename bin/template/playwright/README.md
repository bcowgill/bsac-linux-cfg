To configure this for use on your own project:

package.json, playwright.config.js, config.js etc
  configure the scripts as needed, especially:
  :58008           the port number your local app runs on.
  viewport=600,800 the default browser size to use when recording tests.
  VIEW=600x800     the viewport overrides for :small etc
  VP_SMALL,...     the viewport sizes you want to use forr small, medium, large screen responsive layout screen shots.
  /channel-api/    glob for matching your App's API calls.
  test1            details of your usual testing environment you record from.
  @example,@slow,@iframe, etc for your testing tags.
  BRAND            for alternative brands of your app
  defaultBrand     the default brand/theme for your app
  brandBaseURL     the base url of your app by brand
  9988776655443    the fixed value for the random a= parameter in urls.
  PM=              to change the a= parameter name.
  PORT=58008

## Recording tests with ðŸŽ­Playwright

`npm run record -- site.com` - to open ðŸŽ­Playwright to begin recording manual tests against any given URL

`npm run record:api` - to open ðŸŽ­Playwright against your locally running app and record network API requests to a HAR file in `tests/bugs/har/bug.har`  The example test plan `tests/JIRA-NNNN-template-story.spec.js` demonstrates tests with mock API calls coming from a HAR file.

`npm run record:test1` - to manually record a bug from your testing environment as a ðŸŽ­Playwright test and capture the network API requests to a HAR file in `tests/bugs/har/test1.har`

## Debugging tests with ðŸŽ­Playwright

`npm run ui -- tests/test.spec.js` - to open the ðŸŽ­Playwright Test Runner UI with a specific test plan (or omit it for all tests).  This lets you run tests one at a time or set to watch to rerun them after every code change.

`npm run trace -- tests/test.spec.js` - to run a test and create a ðŸŽ­Playwright trace.zip with a specific test plan.  The trace can be given to someone else to view separately and fully inspect every step of the test without needing ðŸŽ­Playwright installed.  After the trace is recorded, the report is opened.  Can be used by QA engineers who first record the issue with `npm run record` then use this to generate the trace to give to developers to demonstrate the issue and let them do preliminary debugging without needing access to the testing environment.

`npm run viewtrace -- trace.zip` - to open ðŸŽ­Playwright Trace viewer with a specific trace file. Omit to allow drag and drop or opening with the gui.

`npm run debug -- tests/test.spec.js` - to open ðŸŽ­Playwright and step through a specific test plan one line at a time.

`npm run debug:mobile -- tests/test.spec.js` - to open ðŸŽ­Playwright with a mobile device viewport and step through a specific test plan one line at a time.

`npm run devtools -- tests/test.spec.js` - to use Browser Devtools to step through your tests. First add a `await page.pause();` to the test you want to debug.  Then open the Developer Tools in the browser when your test stops.  You will have access to the `playwright` object itself in the console. See [ðŸŽ­Playwright Debugging Tests](https://playwright.dev/docs/debug/)

`npm run test:verbose -- tests/test.spec.js` - to run a test with ðŸŽ­Playwright Test Runner and log all ðŸŽ­Playwright API calls to the console with `pw:api` marker.

`npm run devices` - runs the `tests/debug.spec.js` test to show the list of device formats available for testing. And to debug the ðŸŽ­Playwright Page and testInfo objects.

`npm run visual -- tests/test.spec.js` - runs a test plan with delay between actions so that you can see what is happening, useful for recording a video of an app journey.

## Running the tests and viewing the report

`npm run view` - after running a set of tests this will show the test report in your browser.

`npm run report` - will run the tests with default tag filters and then open the report automatically.

`npm run example` - will only run tests tagged with `@example`.

`npm run quick` - will only run tests that are NOT tagged with `@slow`.

`npm run har` - will only run tests that are tagged with `@har`.

`npm run mockapi` - will only run tests that are tagged with `@mockapi`.

`npm run test` - run all non-`@example` tagged tests in Google Chrome browser. Use `test:edge`, `test:webkit` to run in other browsers or `test:mobile` to run in a mobile sized viewport.  Only files in the `tests/` directory will run.

`npm run test:all` - run all non-`@example` tagged tests in all browsers configured in `playwright.config.js`. 

`npm run test:all:small` - run all non-`@example` tagged tests in all browsers configured in `playwright.config.js` with a small viewport size.  Useful to generate all screenshots for the Small screen size.  Similar commands for `:medium` and `:large` screen sizes.


## Code quality

`npm run format` - will format all the code to standard style, and run linting tasks to highlight any issues.

`npm run eslint:fix` - will fix any lint issues which can be automatically fixed.
