# How to do things with CSS.

Because this has always been a bit of a dark art for me, once something is figured out I capture it here for future reference.

* Add the HTML/semantics for the content.

* Make the spacing look good - margins, padding, etc.
* Box properties (border, background, shadow)
* Typography
* Fun element (gradient, background image, etc)
* Responsive
