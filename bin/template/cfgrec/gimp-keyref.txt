TODO - how to use a pattern with a brush?
how to draw a square, circle, etc?

Getting Unstuck: if gimp seems to have stopped functioning.

Layers - floating selection, anchor or create as new layer
  Invisible current layer - eye symbol
  Layer itself is transparent - set opacity
  Layer is smaller than the image - enlarge the layer
Selection - Ctrl-t to show selection if hidden
  Ctrl-a to select all if you have no selection
  Shift-q to toggle Quick Mask to see the selection
Image - in indexed color mode
Erasers/Brushes don't work - using clipboard brush with empty clipboard


Bug:
When using the filter for brush, pattern, etc it does not match the names shown in the View as List mode. Might be matching tags or something else but not a very good filter experience.
