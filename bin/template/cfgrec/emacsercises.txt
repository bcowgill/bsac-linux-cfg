In the text below move to the uppercased words and then back to the start
using specific movement commands. Repeat each line several times.
Experiment with what word, sentence or paragraph means in other file types
like HTML, lisp, programming lanugages.

     A-f forward to just after end of word
     A-b backward to start of word
     C-e end of the line
     C-a at beginning of the line
	 A-m move to first non-space on line
     A-e end of sentence (just after full stop)
     A-a at start of sentence
     A-} forward to just after the paragaph
     A-{ backward to just before the paragraph

START -> WORD WORD WORD WORD WORD WORD WORD WORD WORD WORD reverse to start

ENDLINE not end of sentence.  not end of sentence.  not end sentence.  HOME

       ENDLINE not end of sentence.  not end of sentence. back to INDENT

go by SENTENCE.  to next SENTENCE.  jump to SENTENCE.  go to SENTENCE.  go
to SENTENCE.  to next SENTENCE.  go by SENTENCE.  reverse by SENTENCE.

go by PARAGRAPH.  then by SENTENCE when you return.

The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to
dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to
assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to
which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect
to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes
which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that
among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  --That to
secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their
just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of
Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People
to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its
foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to
them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not
be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience
hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are
sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they
are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing
invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute
Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such
Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.

--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now
the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of
Government.  The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history
of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the
establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.  To prove this, let
Facts be submitted to a candid world.
