Prompts used to write some code:
create a parametric Queue class of type T with join, serve, length and process functions

add a switchQueue function to move last half of items to a new queue preserving the original order

write a simulator where items arrive with normal distribution every 5 minutes.  once 30 items arrive no more should be added.  start with two queues which process each item in 10 minutes normal distribution.  once a queue has 10 items waiting start another queue and switch the items there. open at most 6 queues. run the simulation and print out how long it takes to process 30 items

Effective Prompt Crafting:

  Clarity    |   Specificity
------------------------------
  Context    |     Intent

Clarity
Specificty
Context   - keep relevant files open in the project and/or highlight the relevant code so copilot can use what is there.
Intent. - give a high level goal to help guide the result
