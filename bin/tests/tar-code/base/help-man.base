       This script can combine multiple source code files into a single file
       with a standard comment banner separating each one, or split a single
       combined file back into the original files.

       If multiple files are given, they are combined (sorted by subdirectory
       depth then alphabetically) and written to STDOUT or the file specified
       with "--output".

       If a single file is given, it is split back into the original files,
       creating subdirectories as needed.

       If "--check" is specified with a single file, the script scans for
       standard banners and reports whether each file exists, will be created,
       or appears multiple times.

       Supports additional comment styles: %, ;, {-} for MATLAB, INI, Haskell,
       and Lua.
