Usage:
    histogram.pl [options] [@options-file ...] [file ...]

    This program will examine the files provided and display histograms of
    word usage for each or for the combined batch of files. The meaning of a
    word can be controlled by command line options. By default all
    punctuation is stripped, words are converted to lower case and the
    histogram of all files provided is output.
