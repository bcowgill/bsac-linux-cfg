usage: assign-to-team.pl [--help|--man|-?] filename...

This will divide up story or task id's or lists among cross-functional teams created on an ad hoc basis.

filename    files to process instead of standard input.
--help      shows help for this program.
--man       shows help for this program.
-?          shows help for this program.

The files processed should define the roles and people available and the list of stories or tasks to divide up.

The format is quite simple.  A hash mark '#' comments out a line so it will be ignored.  For example if a given person is currently away.

A line that ends with a colon ':' defines a role type or begins a list of tasks to divide up.

Task lines are specified as task: tasks: story: or stories:

A line with end: stop: quit: or go: indicates that there is no more. The tasks will be divided up at this point.

Other lines will be added to the current context, either a role list or a task list.

Example:

Use existing team.txt file to divide up the tasks listed in tasks.txt

assign-to-team.pl team.txt tasks.txt
