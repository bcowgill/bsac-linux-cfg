       --inplace        specify to modify files in place creating a backup first
       --echo           display original line when performing replacements
       --version        display program version and exit
       --debug          display debugging info. incremental

Options:
    --color-only
             Only display the CSS color values used. Useful to identify all unique colors used.

    --reverse
             Only display lines that do not contain CSS color declarations.

    --remap
             Remap colors to canonical values and/or names in place where possible. May not produce valid CSS as for example rgba(0,0,0,0.5) becomes rgba(black,0.5)

             You should specify --names or --canonical as well to have any effect.

    --names
             Show colors as standard names where possible. i.e. #fff becomes white.
             Implies --canonical as well.
             Implies --remap as well.

    --canonical
             Show colors in canonical form i.e. #fff becomes '#ffffff'.
             Implies --remap as well.

    --valid-only
             Do not perform name remappings which are invalid css3
             i.e. rgba(0,0,0,0.3) will not become rgba(black,0.3)

    --inplace=.suffix
             Modify files in place and create a backup file first. This acts like perl's -i.suffix option. It's probably a good idea to use --valid-only and not --echo when doing this.

    --echo
             When in a --remap mode, display the original line as well.

    --version
             Prints the program version and exit.

    --help or -?
             Print a brief help message and exit.

    --man
             Print the full help message and exit.
