error: you must specify a target directory

git-mv-src.sh source-file target-dir/ [target-file]

Move a git controlled source file to a new location and adjust all require or import statements which are affected. It modifies the moved file and other git controlled files which import the moved file.

Change the move operation to a copy or move with environment variable MODE=cp or MODE=mv

i.e. MODE=mv git-mv-src.sh source-file target-dir/ [target-file]

It does not support renaming a source file.
It does not support absolute path names in the from and moved to file names.
It only affects imports which have a relative path indication.

It supports a target-file named index.js by assuming it is an import loader for DirName.js where target-dir is of the form path/DirName.  In this case it will write the import as import DirName from 'path/DirName', instead of path/DirName/index.

These would be corrected:

... import .... './path/Object'
... require ... '../path/Object'
... requireJson ... '../path/Object'

These would not be corrected:

... import .... 'path/Object'
... import js from '!!raw!./ScopedSelectors.js';


src/X/Y/File.js:
import Here from './Here';
import There from '../../Z/There';
src/X/Y/Here.js:
src/Z/External.js:
import File from '../X/Y/File';
src/Z/There.js:
