error: you must specify a target directory

git-mv-src.sh source-file target-dir/ [target-file]

Move a git controlled source file to a new location and adjust all require or import statements which are affected. It modifies the moved file and other git controlled files which import the moved file.

It does not support renaming a source file.
It does not support absolute path names in the from and moved to file names.
It only affects imports which have a relative path indication.

These would be corrected:

... import .... './path/Object'
... require ... '../path/Object'
... requireJson ... '../path/Object'

These would not be corrected:

... import .... 'path/Object'


src/X/Y/Here.js:
src/X/Y/File.js:
import Here from './Here';
import There from '../../Z/There';
src/Z/There.js:
src/Z/External.js:
import File from '../X/Y/File';
