Specify TEST=1 renumber-files.sh ... as command to only test what would happen but not do it.

Note that no filename checking is done on the new file name so any existing numbered file will be overwritten if it already exists.

Use next-file.pl or auto-rename.pl if number collisions are likely to happen and you don't want to overwrite existing files.
