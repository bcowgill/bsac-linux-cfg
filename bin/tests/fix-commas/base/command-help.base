usage: ../../fix-commas.pl [--leading] [--help] filename...

Fixes comma placement in files specified.  Default is to move leading commas on a line to the end of the previous line.

--leading causes trailing commas to be placed as leading commas on the next line.

i.e.
	var thisThing // this thing
		, thatThing; // that thing

becomes

	var this, // this thing
		that; // that thing

and vice versa if --leading is specified.
