unrecognised option '--invalid'

pee.pl [--append] [--control] [--help|--man|-?] file_name

Similar to tee but with date and elapsed time, line wrapping and removal of ANSI terminal control characters.

COLUMNS   environment variable specifying what colum to wrap for the log file. default 60. Specify 0 for no wrapping.
UPDATE    specifies to output to stdout only every UPDATE lines. The log file will have everything but the console will have less output.
--append  appends to the named log file instead of overwriting it.
--control shows ANSI ESC control sequences instead of replacing them with whitespace.
--help    shows help for this program.
--man     shows help for this program.
-?        shows help for this program.

This program will print standard input to standard output and clean it up before writing it to the log file.

It will also wrap the output to the current COLUMNS environment setting.

It can reduce the output shown on the console to prevent slowing things down.

Example:

	Run the tests, filter out 0/100 coverage and also log the results to a file.

npm test | filter-coverage.sh | pee.pl tests.log

	Find files and log them all, but only print out every 250 to reduce console noise.

find / -type f | UPDATE=250 pee.pl files.lst
