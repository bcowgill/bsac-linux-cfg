The color scale will range from the maximum possible CSS color value which intersects the color value given to one ninth of that value.  The output will be weighted from 100 to 900 with 100 being the darkest and 900 the brightest version of the color.  The given color may not fall on one of those weights but will be available in the CSS and JS output exactly.

By default the color will be maxmised along its vector but if USE_COLOR environment variable is true then the color itself will be used for weight 900 and all other values will be a fraction of the given color.

The color name will be lowercased for output to CSS.  A dash in the color name becomes an _ for Javascript output.
