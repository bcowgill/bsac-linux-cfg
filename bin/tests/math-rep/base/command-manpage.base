LITERAL REPLACEMENTS

- Fractions which have specific unicode characters:

0/3 1/10 1/9 1/8 1/7 1/6 1/5 1/4 1/3 3/8 2/5 1/2 3/5 5/8 2/3 3/4 4/5 5/6 7/8 1/

- Multi-character symbols with surrounding whitespace which can be replaced by specific unicode characters:

<=  >=  ==  ~=

Symbols are typed from left to right and represent the line strokes going from top to bottom.

i.e. ' <= ' is less than sign with equal sign below.

Normally a single whitespace is preserved around the symbol but you can use the CUDDLE option to remove it after replacement.
