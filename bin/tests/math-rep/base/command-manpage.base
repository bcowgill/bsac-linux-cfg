There is a sample file categoriesed by replacement types:

/PATH/bin/character-samples/samples/mathematics-categorised.txt

LITERAL REPLACEMENTS

- Fractions which have specific unicode characters:

0/3 1/10 1/9 1/8 1/7 1/6 1/5 1/4 1/3 3/8 2/5 1/2 3/5 5/8 2/3 3/4 4/5 5/6 7/8 1/

- Multi-character symbols with surrounding whitespace which can be replaced by specific unicode characters:

<=  >=  ==  ~=

Symbols are typed from left to right and represent the line strokes going from top to bottom.

i.e. ' <= ' is less than sign with equal sign below.

Normally a single whitespace is preserved around the symbol but you can use the CUDDLE option to remove it after replacement.

- Multi-character symbols which can be replaced by specific unicode characters:

+-

MARKUP REPLACEMENTS

Multi-characters and additional markup which can be replaced by specific unicode characters:

- Subscripts on algebraic variables and constants:

X_0 X_1 X_2 X_3 X_4 X_5 X_6 X_7 X_8 X_9
X_a X_e X_h X_i X_j X_k X_l X_m X_n X_o X_p X_r X_s X_t X_u X_v X_x
X_beta X_gamma X_rho X_phi X_chi X_schwa
X_+ X_- X_= X_( X_) X_< X_> X_... X_<-
X_. X_*

X_2_3_._1_4
X_(_2_*_5_)
X_n_=_1_..._1_0
X_i_<_j
X_i_>_2
X_n_<-_m

Note: there are no unicode characters for these below, so they do nothing.

X_b X_c X_d X_f X_g X_q X_w X_y X_z
X_/ X_[ X_] X_->
X_A and all other capital letters
X_alpha and many other greek letters

- Superscripts or exponentiation on algebraic variables and constants:

X^0 X^1 X^2 X^3 X^4 X^5 X^6 X^7 X^8 X^9
X^G X^I X^N X^U
X^a X^b X^c X^d X^e X^f X^g X^h X^i X^j X^k X^l X^m X^n X^o X^p X^r X^s X^t X^u X^v X^w X^x X^y X^z
X^GAMMA X^PHI
X^alpha X^beta X^gamma X^delta X^theta X^iota X^upsilon X^phi X^chi X^schwa
X^+ X^- X^= X^( X^) X^< X^>
X^. X^*

Note: there are no unicode characters for these below, so they do nothing.

X^q
X^rho
X^... X^<-
X^A and many other capital letters
X^ALPHA and many other greek capital letters
