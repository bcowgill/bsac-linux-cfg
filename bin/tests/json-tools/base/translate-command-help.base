json-translate.pl [--help|--man|-?] language.json foreign.json

This will merge two translation JSON files together to provide a translation key.

--help  shows help for this program.
--man   shows help for this program.
-?      shows help for this program.

Whenever a key from foreign.json matches a key from language.json, both values will be output next to each other with the foreign.json key coming last.  Mismatched keys will also be output.

Assumes pretty formatted json with each key/value on separate lines with simple key: string-value structure no deep values.

Also assumes there will be no double-quotes in the key/value strings and so removes them all.
