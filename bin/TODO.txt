1. Cuckoo program horse sound should be replaced, not so good.
2. update npm perljs package latest tools and publish. Then convert to Typescript latest < 5
3. a better typeOf function: null == null {} == object  Date == object:Date function == object:Function Array == object:Array
  -- IT IS possible to do anonymous constructors new (function (x, y) { this.x = x; this.y = y})(42,12) -- so should use anonymous as func/type name where possible
  -- look at lodash _.isX functions https://lodash.com/docs/#isArrayLike is there a similar type of function?
  -- can give names to any anonymous functions discovered:
  if !x.constructor.name ...
  > anon.set(x.constructor, 'anon' + anon.size)
  Map { [Function] => 'anon0' }
  > anon.has(x.constructor)
  true
  > anon.has(x.constructor) && anon.get(x.constructor)
  'anon0'
  x = new Map()
  !x.constructor.name && (anon.has(x.constructor) ? anon.get(x.constructor) : anon.set(x.constructor, 'anon' + anon.size).get(x.constructor))

4. A better JSON.stringify for Set Map, etc  Set => ['object:JSONSet', item, item...] .stringify uses a replacer to convert Set to array and a .parse function to convert back to a real set.

To celebrate Randsday, you do something not done on any other holiday: you give yourself a present. Randsday is for getting that longed-for luxury you ordinarily would not buy for yourself. Or for doing that long-postponed, self-pampering activity you cannot seem to fit into your chore-packed schedule.

Randsday is the time to challenge any duty-premise, re-affirm your love of your values, and honor the principle that joy in living is an end in itself.
