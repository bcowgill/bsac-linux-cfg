# resize +/-N to change region height by a few lines

# example set up with two windows shell and a logged telnet
# screen 1  # shell
# screen -fn -t telnet-foobar -L 2 telnet foobar

#screen -t shell 0
#screen -t midnight 1
#screen -t manual-page 2
#screen -t top 3 nice top
#screen -t test-plans 4

blankerprg txt-screen-saver.sh
#blankerprg cmatrix -b -s -C magenta
idle 300 blanker
