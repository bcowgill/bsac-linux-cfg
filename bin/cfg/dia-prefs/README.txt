these are the preferences files for dia diagram program with white or dark background.

to use one or the other just copy them into place.

cp -r dia-dark/* ~/.dia
cp -r dia-white/* ~/.dia

every now and then they should be backed up againg and diffed to the other shade to keep the recent files up to date.
