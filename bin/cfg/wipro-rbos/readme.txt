Staging area for bringing my dev tools to a new client windows workstation.

home - shell startup configuration, somewhat common, somewhat CUSTOM - grep for CUSTOM on client machine to configure
home/bin - my universal tools that work an any OS, use ./stage-tools.sh to copy them over
home/bin/cfg/wipro-$COMPANY  - specifically configured tools for client environment
