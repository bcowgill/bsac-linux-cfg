# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack when it reacts to git push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to updateInstead. Such a push by default is refused if the working tree and the index of the remote repository has any difference from the currently checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default behaviour.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current branch is going to be updated. It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does so, it must not modify the index or the working tree). Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1" in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction with git push, as the two-tree form of read-tree -u -m is essentially the same as git checkout that switches branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do not interfere with the difference between the branches.
